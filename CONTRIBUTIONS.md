# Contribution notes

This project is primarily hosted [here](https://git.speedie.site/speedie/docpp). It is also mirrored to GitHub,
[here](https://github.com/speedie1337/docpp), both for visibility and for CI purposes. You may file issues and
pull requests on both platforms. Commits made on GitHub *may* be squashed into a single commit and merged into
the main repository on the primary host. If you do not want your commits squashed, please make them on the primary
host. You still retain authorship of your commits.

Happy hacking!
